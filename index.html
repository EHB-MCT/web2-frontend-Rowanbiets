                            <p>the most numerous and weakest piece in the game of chess. It may move one vacant
                                square
                                directly
                                forward, it may move two vacant squares directly forward on its first move, and it

                                capture

                                square diagonally forward. Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each
                                square of
                                their
                                second rank. The white pawns start on a2 through h2; the black pawns start on a7
                                through h7.

                            <p>represented by a horse's head and neck. It moves two squares vertically and one
                                square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically, jumping
                                over other pieces. Each player starts the game with two knights on the b- and
                                g-files, each located between a rook and a bishop.

                                player begins the game with two bishops. One starts between the king's knight and
                                the king, the other between the queen's knight and the queen. The starting squares
                                are c1 and f1 for White's bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops.

                                castling. Each player starts the game with two rooks, one in each corner on their
                                own side of the board.

                                vertically, horizontally or diagonally, combining the powers of the rook and bishop.
                                Each player starts the game with one queen, placed in the middle of the first rank
                                next to the king. Because the queen is the strongest piece, a pawn is promoted to a
                                queen in the vast majority of cases.

                            <h1>King</h1>
                            <p> The most important piece in the game of chess. It may move to any adjoining square;
                                it may also perform a move known as castling. If a player's king is threatened with
                                capture, it is said to be in check, and the player must remove the threat of capture
                                on the next move. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate,
                                resulting in a loss for that player. A player cannot make any move that places their
                                own king in check. Despite this, the king can become a strong offensive piece in the
                                endgame or, rarely, the middlegame.
