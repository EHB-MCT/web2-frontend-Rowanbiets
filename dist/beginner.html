                            <p>The most numerous and weakest piece in the game of chess. It may move one vacant square directly forward, it may move two vacant squares directly forward on its first move, and it may capture one square diagonally forward. Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of their second rank. The white pawns start on a2 through h2; the black pawns start on a7 through h7.</p>

                            <p>Represented by a horse's head and neck. It moves two squares vertically and one
                                square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically,
                                jumping over other pieces. Each player starts the game with two knights on the b-
                                and g-files, each located between a rook and a bishop.</p>

                                player begins the game with two bishops. One starts between the king's knight and
                                the king, the other between the queen's knight and the queen. The starting squares
                                are c1 and f1 for White's bishops, and c8 and f8 for Black's bishops.</p>

                                it may capture an enemy piece on its path; additionally, it may participate in
                                castling. Each player starts the game with two rooks, one in each corner on their
                                own side of the board.</p>

                            <p>The most powerful piece in the game of chess. It can move any number of squares
                                vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, combining the powers of the rook and
                                bishop. Each player starts the game with one queen, placed in the middle of the
                                first rank next to the king. Because the queen is the strongest piece, a pawn is
                                promoted to a queen in the vast majority of cases.</p>

                                it may also perform a move known as castling. If a player's king is threatened with
                                capture, it is said to be in check, and the player must remove the threat of
                                capture on the next move. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in
                                checkmate, resulting in a loss for that player.</p>
